# Ethical AI Usage Statement

**Repository Mirror** is designed with a "Growth-First" philosophy. We believe automated evaluation tools must be transparent mentors, not opaque gatekeepers.

## 1. Transparency & Explainability
We reject "Black Box" scoring. Every point awarded or deducted by our system is traceable to a specific, explainable heuristic (e.g., "Missing tests", "Flat directory"). Users have the right to know exactly *why* they received a score and *how* to improve it.

## 2. Non-Discrimination
Our algorithms analyze code structure, metadata, and git history. We strictly do not process, store, or factor in author demographics, names, locations, or institutions. We evaluate the artifact, not the person.

## 3. Tool for Growth, Not Judgment
This system is an **Automated Mentor**. Its primary purpose is to provide feedback that accelerates a developer's journey from "Student" to "Professional". A low score is not a condemnation of potential; it is a roadmap for learning.

## 4. Responsible Use Guidelines
*   **For Educators:** Use this tool to scale feedback on basic hygiene (git, structure), allowing you to focus grading on logic and creativity.
*   **For Recruiters:** This tool quantifies *readiness*, not *intelligence*. It should verify technical baselines, never replace human conversation or technical interviewing.

*We are committed to building AI that empowers developers.*
