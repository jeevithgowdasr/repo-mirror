# 🎥 Repository Mirror – Demo Video Script (60-90s)

**Target Audience:** Hackathon Judges & Recruiters  
**Tone:** Professional, Fast-paced, Impact-oriented

---

### **0:00 – 0:15 | The Problem (Face Camera or "Bad Repo" Screenshot)**
"We’ve all seen it. A student has a great idea, but their GitHub repository is a mess. Flat file structures, zero documentation, no tests, and code dumps. 
To a recruiter, this screams 'amateur'. 
But students don't know what they don't know."

### **0:15 – 0:30 | The Solution (Show Architecture/Title Slide)**
"Introducing **Repository Mirror**. 
It’s an AI-powered code auditor that evaluates repositories against industry standards. 
Unlike simple linters, it analyses the *entire* project lifecycle: structure, consistency, documentation, and review-readiness."

### **0:30 – 0:60 | The Live Demo (Screen Share: API Client / Postman)**
*(Action: Open Postman/swurl, paste a GitHub URL into the `/analyze` endpoint)*
"Let's see it in action. I’m feeding it a typical junior developer repository.
I hit `POST /analyze`... and in milliseconds, we get a comprehensive audit."

*(Action: Scroll through the JSON response)*
"Here’s what we get back:
1.  **A Deterministic Score**: 45/100. It’s objective.
2.  **The Metadata**: It caught the missing tests and the flat directory structure."

### **0:60 – 0:80 | The Insight (Focus on Summary & Roadmap)**
"But here is the magic. 
Look at the **Summary**: It’s not generic advice. It reads like a senior engineer's performance review—direct and honest.
And the **Roadmap**: It gives strict, actionable steps. 
*‘Zero Tolerance for Untested Code’* 
*‘Refactor Architecture’*
It tells the student exactly *how* to fix their specific weaknesses."

### **0:80 – 0:90 | Closing (Face Camera or Logo)**
"Repository Mirror bridges the gap between academic coding and production engineering. 
We aren't just grading code; we're building better engineers.
Thank you."
