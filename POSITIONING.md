# Project Positioning: Repository Mirror

## The Problem
Junior developers often treat GitHub as cloud storage rather than a professional portfolio, submitting unstructured "code dumps" that function but fail basic engineering standards. Hiring managers struggle to instantly signal-check these repositories, often rejecting capable talent because their work lacks modularity, documentation, and rigorous workflow. There is a critical missing feedback loop between academic coding and production-ready engineering expectations.

## The Solution
Repository Mirror acts as an automated Senior Architect, performing a holistic audit of a codebase's health beyond just syntax. It utilizes a deterministic scoring engine to assess architectural depth, testing culture, and commit hygiene, translating raw metadata into a "hireability" index. This system provides students with the ruthless, actionable mentorship needed to transition from writing scripts to building maintainable software products.

## The Differentiator
While GitHub Insights measures *activity volume* and linters verify *syntactical correctness*, Repository Mirror evaluates **engineering maturity**—assessing architectural intent and process discipline to determine actual professional readiness.
